This is a repo about Python programming. 

ðŸ’¾ Projects
------------
## _plot
Extracting data from a text file and then making plot for analysis utilizing `matplotlib`

## attitude 
Operations about SO(3) utilizing the following custom modules:  
- **SO3.py** - attitude represntation and transformation
  - `Rx()`, `Ry()`, `Rz()`: rotation along *x*, *y* and *z* axis in SO(3).
  - `hat()`: Hat map, it transfers a 3x1 vector to a 3x3 skew-symmetric matrix, which is very useful in describing rotational motion
  - `vee()`: Vee map: inverse of hat map
  - `glRotate()`: mimicing `glRotate()` function in OpenGL
  - `rodriguesToSO3()`: converting Rodrigues formula to rotation matrix
  - `unitQuatToSO3()`: converting unit quaternion to rotation matrix
  - `SO3ToUnitQuat()`: mapping rotation matrix to unit quaternion
- **S3.py** 
  - `multiplication()`: multiplication of 2 quaternions
